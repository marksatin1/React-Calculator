# REACT CALCULATOR

- State handling = [calc, setCalc]

sign = + or - sign
num = entered value
res = calculated value

## Screen Component

- If a number is clicked, the Screen displays that number

- If the '=' button is clicked, the Screen calculates the result and displays it

# REACT NOTES

- Whenver we add a callback function to a setState function, React AUTOMATICALLY passes the previous state to that callback as an argument.

- in JS when you add a number to a string, the interpreter converts the num to a str and concatenates the result. This is why 3 + '.' = '3.'

- 0 evaluates to false in JS. '0' is a string that is not empty and therefore evaluates to true.

### Functionality To Add

- User can use keys instead of clicking

- Display selected sign in Screen component smaller and maybe to the left

- bootstrapping
